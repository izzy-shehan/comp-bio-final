                    <h3>Predicting odors with organic structure</h3>

                    <p>
                        Knowing the vapor pressure of a molecule is not enough to predict its odor. Instead, we should take a look at the
                        compound’s <b>functional group</b>. A functional group is an arrangement of atoms constituting a portion of a larger molecule.
                        Often, these groups are responsible for a compound’s participation in certain pathways and chemical reactions.
                    </p>

                    <p class='image'><img src='images/functional-groups.png' width='90%'></p>

                    <p>
                        Odorant groups that have the same functional group appear to have similar odor. A potential explanation of this is that
                        the functional groups of odorant molecules bind in a similar way to olfactory receptors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Molecules with the following functional groups tend to have similar odors – 

                        <ul class='f-groups'>
                            <li><b style='color:#EB9FEF'>esters</b> – fruit/floral</li>
                            <li><b style='color:#EB9FEF'>amines</b> – animal/roasted</li>
                            <li><b style='color:#EB9FEF'>thiols</b> – rotten/alliaceous</li>
                            <li><b style='color:#EB9FEF'>aldehydes</b> – grassy/greens</li>
                            <li><b style='color:#EB9FEF'>lactones</b> – coconut/apricot</li>
                            <li><b style='color:#EB9FEF'>volatile fatty acids</b> – rancid/sour</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Below are some highlights and fun facts pertaining to how certain functional groups relate to various odors!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Common aroma compounds</h3>

                    <h4>Esters</h4>

                    <p>
                        Notice that all of these odorant molecules responsible for fruity and floral aromas contain an ester group.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Terpenes</h4>

                    <p>
                        Terpenes have been widely studied in recent years due to their presence in hemp/cannabis. They could potentially be
                        exploited to generate pain therapies, but research into the area is ongoing.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Amines</h4>

                    <p>
                        A fishy odor is often attributed to amines. In general, this functional group is associated with extremely unpleasant
                        scents.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Thiols</h4>

                    <p>
                        Thiols are generally responsible for some pungent, unpleasant odors. However, some compounds with thiols are responsible
                        for the smell of coffee and notes in wines like Sauvignon Blanc.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Limitations of predicting odor based organic structure</h3>

                    <p>
                        Functional groups can’t predict all odors. For example, the following three lactones in the visual below have very
                        similar structures but extremely distinctive smells.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Enantiomeric compounds are compounds with the same structural connectivity, but different orientations in space.
                        Enantiomers are often thought of as gloves for the right and left hands: extremely similar but not interchangeable,
                        mirror images of each other. Only as few as 5% of enantiomer pairings have alike smell as shown in the figure below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Moreover, structurally different compounds can also have similar odors such as the musk compounds found in the visual
                        below.
                    </p>

                    <p class='last'>
                        Most importantly, small structural changes in a molecule can also decrease odor intensity/detectability significantly.
