                    <p>
                        Biomarkers are physiological indicators – found in blood, fluids, or tissues – of biological 
                        processes. A evaluation metric for normal clinical function, biomarkers can be predictive, prognostic,
                        or diagnostic. Indicators of conditions like cancer or adverse pharmacological responses, computational 
                        biomarkers – assisted by machine learning models and AI frameworks – are a rapidly advancing field of study.

                    <h4>Some people can smell Parkinson’s disease</h4>

                    <p>
                        Joy Milne arrived home from work one day and noticed her husband had a peculiar “musky” scent. She had never smelled it
                        before and after pleading with him to shower, the smell still lingered. It wasn’t until 12 years later that he was
                        diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Attendance at a Parkinson’s disease support group was what linked the smell to the disease for Milne as she was
                        overwhelmed by the scent coming off the many Parkinson’s patients in the room. Her husband agreed the scent must be
                        linked to the disease somehow and they presented their discovery to a number of doctors and researchers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, scientists have been conducting research to determine whether odorants on the skin may be utilized for early
                        detection of Parkinson’s disease. Such a discovery is <em>critical</em>, as Parkinson’s currently lacks a significant 
                        biomarker.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Dogs can detect cancer through smell</h4>

                    <p>
                        Dogs can detect cancer in breath, skin, sweat, urine, blood, and feces. Currently, scientists are attempting to
                        capitalize on the smelling capabilities of dogs to develop canine-trained machine learning algorithms called
                        <em>e-noses</em>. E-noses work by combining principles of gas chromatography, an approach that enables chemists 
                        to distinguish between compounds, and artificial intelligence.

                    <h3>Smell across species</h3>
                    <p>
                        Analyzing olfactory receptor genes across species allows us to track evolutionary mammalian patterns.
                        In comparing functional vs non-functional OR expression, we can isolate the olfactory range of each species.
                    </p>

                    <p class='image'><img src='/images/mammal-or-ev.png' width='75%'></p>

                    <p>
                        Humans (the tenth bar from the right) realize a significantly smaller range of odorants than most species –
                        a phylogenetic tree of OR gene divergence (shown below) illustrates the extent of this loss.
                    </p>

                    <p class='image'><img src='/images/phylo-or.jpeg' width='75%'></p>

                    <p>
                        While humans still retain 821 OR genes, we currently have <b>more pseudogenes for olfactory receptors than
                        working ones</b>. How frustrating (or wonderful) we never experience the broad spectrum of scents out there!!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Smell capabilities of the sexes</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Generally, females see a stronger sense of smell than males</b>. Research into sex-discrepancies for olfaction
                        offers 2 possible explanations: 

                        <ol>
                            <li>the threshold for the minimum number of compounds needed to detect smell is lower for females;</li>
                            <li>females have more neural connections to olfactory receptors than males.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p class='last'>
                        Research into sex-based olfactory discrepancies is slowly advancing, with multiple studies currently evaluating
                        the effects of birth control on female olfactory systems. Initial studies are contradictory (<a 
                        class="active" href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2041669520983339'>this</a> study says <em>no</em>
                        while <a class='active' href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5176159/'>this</a> study says <em>yes</em>),
                        but any exploration into sex-disaggregated data is a positive.
