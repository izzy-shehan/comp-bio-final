                <p>
                    This site is a comprehensive guide to how we smell (a process called <em>olfaction</em>), exploring everything 
                    from the physiological system that translates sensory input to the organic structures
                    that dictate aroma.

                    <h3>What are odors?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Odors are volatile chemicals that humans perceive as a sense of smell. If an odor has a pleasant smell 
                        it is often referred to as a fragrance or aroma. However, if it has an unpleasant smell it is known as a
                        reek, stench, or stink. The molecules that produce odors are also known as aroma compounds or odorants. 
                        High vapor pressure allows odorants to be dispersed through the air.

                    <h3>How do we detect smells?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Humans have sensory neurons (refered to as olfactory receptors) in the back of our nasal cavities. 
                        Each neuron has cilia extending into the air with receptor proteins on the end that bind to aroma 
                        compounds. An electrical signal in each neuron sends information to olfactory nerves (or olfactory 
                        bulbs) in the brain. Humans require a minimum number of compounds to inhale before we can detect a scent. 
                        Some scents may not be identifiable because we do not process single compounds or their concentrations, 
                        but rather a <em>combination</em> of compounds.
