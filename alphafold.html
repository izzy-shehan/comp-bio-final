                <h2>Modeling receptor-binding with AlphaFold</h2>

                <p>
                    If you’ve read through the olfactory pathway page and are interested
                    in a more detailed description of how odorants bind to olfactory receptors (ORs),
                    look no further!
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Protein-ligand bonding</h3>
        
                    <p>
                        A <b>ligand</b> is a chemical compound or protein that is capable of binding to a protein. The ligands we care about in
                        olfaction are <b>odorant molecules</b>. Molecular interactions, steric effects (energy-driven interactions that
                        influence a molecule's shape and reactivity), and other physical and chemical properties govern whether a ligand
                        will bind a protein. Oftentimes, binding is localized to a certain location on the protein, called the <b>active site</b>. 
                        The binding mechanism is analogous to encryption and decryption in some ways. Compounds can be thought of as encrypted files, 
                        where certain strings of atoms within the molecule are the strings of information hidden in the file. Proteins on the other 
                        hand, are analogous to decryption algorithms required for access to the encrypted data. When atoms of specific amino acids 
                        of a protein form bonds with atoms of the compound, the protein decodes the message being sent by the compound by altering its conformation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Though it is not inherent in all compound-protein interactions, conformational alteration of the protein is a common
                        response to interaction with a compound. This detail is crucial for understanding that an odorant binding to the
                        olfactory receptor adjusts conformation of the protein in a way that triggers a cascade of events. The change in
                        conformation is necessary to ensure that the signal cascade is not continuously activated. The binding event is the
                        “on-switch”.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Developments in 3D visualizations of odorant-OR interactions</h3>

                    <p>
                        Current methods of prediction for compound-ligand interactions are reliant on machine learning as well as extensive
                        databases on compound and protein structures. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) – like the <a class='active' href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471220300818#fig1'>MONN</a> network
                        architecture shown below – are wildly popular structures for protein-ligand modeling. 
                    </p>

                    <p class='image'><img src='/images/monn-arch.png' width='80%'></p>

                    <p>
                        Other computational approaches – like <a class='active' href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131077'>mini-virtual screening</a> – highlight the interactions between atoms of the compound and amino acids of the protein
                        to isolate the active site for the interaction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While we are able to visualize active sites and protein-compound interactions for proteins whose active sites have been
                        successfully determined experimentally, it is much more difficult to produce comparable visualizations for proteins
                        whose structure is difficult to determine experimentally.
                    </p>


                    <h4 class='first'>Why is it so difficult to generate 3D visualizations of odorant-OR interactions?</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        There is limited knowledge of the specific binding of olfactory receptor proteins to odorants because it is difficult to
                        conduct experiments that accurately depict what is happening <em>in vivo</em> (in the body). Olfactory receptors are G-protein
                        coupled receptors (GPCR). GPCRs have posed challenges for researchers as isolation of intact GPCRs through experimental
                        means is almost impossible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, what we can deduce experimentally is whether or not a certain molecule will bind an olfactory receptor. In some
                        cases, the binding affinity – how strong a compound’s interaction with the protein is – can be determined. Advances in
                        machine learning, as well as the breakthroughs in protein modeling with Alpha Fold are promising steps toward
                        a computational method for predicted compound-protein interactions in the near future.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What is AlphaFold?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The AlphaFold project was started in 2016 by DeepMind, and the source code for the AI system was made available to the
                        public in 2020. AlphaFold2, an updated version of AlphaFold has successfully achieved protein structure
                        accuracy comparable to that of experimental procedures in labs. Generally, an accuracy of above 90% is considered to be
                        within the threshold required for a predicted structure to be considered reliable. This bodes very well for researcher’s
                        ability to visualize and predict structures of GPCRs.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Amino acid sequences, the primary structure of proteins, serve as input to the program. The idea is to enter the amino
                        acid sequence derived from the genetic code of a protein and receive a 3D model of the protein as output. The model
                        consists of a recurrent convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to sequence alignments between the amino acid
                        sequence of the input and amino acid sequences of homologous proteins with known 3D structures from genetic databases.
                        Iterative refinement is implemented to continually adjust the conformation as the algorithm runs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        AlphaFold has revolutionized 3D protein modeling, but the system is simply the tip of the iceberg in terms of predicting
                        the vast array of conformations individual proteins can take on. With promising results for structural analysis of
                        GPCRs, depictions of olfactory receptors interacting with odorants is surely not far off.
