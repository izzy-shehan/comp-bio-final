                    <p>
                        Biomarkers are physiological indicators – found in blood, fluids, or tissues – of biological 
                        processes. A evaluation metric for normal clinical function, biomarkers can be predictive, prognostic,
                        or diagnostic. Indicators of conditions like cancer or adverse pharmacological responses, biomarkers are
                        a rapidly advancing field of study.

                    <h4>Some people can smell Parkinson’s disease</h4>

                    <p>
                        Joy Milne arrived home from work one day and noticed her husband had a peculiar “musky” scent. She had never smelled it
                        before and after pleading with him to shower, the smell still lingered. It wasn’t until 12 years later that he was
                        diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Attendance at a Parkinson’s disease support group was what linked the smell to the disease for Milne as she was
                        overwhelmed by the scent coming off the many Parkinson’s patients in the room. Her husband agreed the scent must be
                        linked to the disease somehow and they presented their discovery to a number of doctors and researchers.

                    <p>
                        Today, scientists have been conducting research to determine whether odorants on the skin may be utilized for early
                        detection of Parkinson’s disease. Such a discovery is <em>critical</em>, as Parkinson’s currently lacks a significant 
                        biomarker.

                    <h4>Dogs can detect cancer through smell</h4>

                    <p>
                        Dogs can detect cancer in breath, skin, sweat, urine, blood, and feces. Currently, scientists are attempting to
                        capitalize on the smelling capabilities of dogs to develop canine-trained machine learning algorithms called
                        <em>e-noses</em>. E-noses work by combining principles of gas chromatography, an approach that enables chemists 
                        to distinguish between compounds, and artificial intelligence.

                    <h3>Smell across species</h3>
                    <p>
                        Analyzing olfactory receptor genes across species allows us to track evolutionary mammalian patterns.
                        In comparing functional vs non-functional OR expression, we can isolate the olfactory range of each species.
